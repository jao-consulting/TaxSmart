## Context

We need to define the architecture of the backend. This architecture should be able to be applied to all the different
components of the backend.

## Decision

We'll follow the clean architecture with a clear input and output services. This architecture is based on the idea that
we should have a clear separation of the different layers of the application. This will allow us to have a more
maintainable codebase.

## Consequences

This architecture will allow us to build a robust software with a high quality. It will also allow us to refactor the
code easily if needed.
