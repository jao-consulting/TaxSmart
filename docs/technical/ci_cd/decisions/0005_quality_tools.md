## Context

In order to deliver a high quality product, we need to have a set of tools that will help us to achieve this goal, as
this is an open source project, we need to use free tools.

We'll need mainly 3 tools:

- Code coverage Tool
- Docker image registry
- Security Analysis Tool
- Code quality Tool

## Decision

After searching for the best tools, we decided to use the following ones:

- Code coverage Tool: [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/)
- Docker image registry: [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/about-github-container-registry)
- Security Analysis Tool: [CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql)
- Code quality Tool: [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/)

## Consequences

By using these tools, we'll be able to have a high quality product, with a good code coverage, a good security and good
quality code standards.
